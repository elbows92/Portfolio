                                    <p>My team and I were tasked with redesigning the life insurance account opening process of a financial services company to attract more agents, transform underwriting, and align workstreams. These goals were based off of several key insights made by the company, which described a system with many duplicative processes, and a lack of understanding of emerging agent demographics.</p>

                            <p>A service blueprint captures all of the key stages of a service across front and backstage platforms. In contrast, a journey map focuses on a customer’s experience as they move through the different touchpoints of a service. Using both would provide a clear view of the service, while retaining an emphasis on the interactions between customers and agents, and touch points that warrant design intervention.
