                            <p>After establishing a high level understanding of how life insurance agents conduct their business, we shifted our attention to the process of buying life insurance as a whole.</p>
                            <p>The best tool for this job was a combination of a service blueprint and a customer journey map. The format of a service blueprint would adequately capture the complexity of buying life insurance including front and back stage processes. Incorporating elements of a customer journey map would allow us to stay focused on the customer, their interactions with the agent, and touch points that warrant design intervention. These methods are described in greater detail at Cooper.</p>
