Lance and Mo encountered many problems with the array of components we wanted to use to create a wireless connection between the two devices; subsequently, the dimensions of the device were constantly in flux.</p>
                            <p>In order to work in tandem with my colleagues, I created many rapid prototypes out of felt and cardboard that reflected all the possible component configurations they were testing.
